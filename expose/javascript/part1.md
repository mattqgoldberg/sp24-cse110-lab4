1. line 9 prints 'values added: 20'

2. line 13 prints 'final result: 20'

3. line 9 prints 'values added: 20'

4. line 13 produces an error that says 'result is not defined'. This is because we declared the variable result using let, so the scope of the variable is only inside of the if statement.

5. line 9 is never reached, the error is at line 7 where we attempt to reassign a value to a variable that we declared a const.

6. line 13 is never reached, same reason as above.
